Installing
----------

Quick installing on Ubuntu. You'll need Python and Redis installed
(apt-get install redis-server should do the trick for the latter).

> virtualenv venv
> source venv/bin/activate
> pip install -r requirements.txt
> python manage runserver (starts the web server)

The rhino brain receives events at /events/ via POST, in JSON form (the
JSON should be the value of the 'json' key in the query). It has a very
simple structure, shown below: 'event' indicates the sensor from which
it came ('vision') and the event itself ('scanned'). 'params' can be
any values in a dictionary (in this case, the scanned item).

{
	'event':'vision.scanned_qr',
	'params': {
		'item':'leaf'
	}
}

You can go to /state/ to see the current state of the rhino (long_term
contains counts of the various events, short_term contains the 10 most
recent events).
